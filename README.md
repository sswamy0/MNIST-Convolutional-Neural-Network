# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Network
A CNN in Python from scratch with no external libraries to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.Utilizes a modular neural network architecture with dynamic layer configuration, enabling the creation of deep, multi-layered models. Allows for customization of number of neurons, filter sizes, activation functions, and learning rates among all layers.

Make sure your path to the test and train CSVs are accurate
